Motivation Behind Generics : Typically you want a container to hold multiple types of objects, but typically you only put one type of objects at a time. We'd like to use an unspecified type, which can be decided later.

Tuple: When you want to return multiple objects from a method call, you can create a single object that does that called as Tuple, you can use the Generics to solve this issue and ensure compile-time type safety. Recipient of the object is allowed to read the elements but no put the new ones. (Concept called Data Transfer Object)
